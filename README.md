### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Caique Morales, and I have been a developer for 4 years now, specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native, and Firebase. I have been honing my skills in React and Firebase, which have become the primary technologies for both my personal and professional projects.

I also have a deep passion for CSS and its ability to offer responsiveness and captivating visual elements. I can confidently say that I am genuinely passionate about it.

In addition, I take great pride in applying clean code principles to my development process. I believe that writing clean, organized, and maintainable code is crucial for building scalable and efficient applications. Furthermore, I follow a mobile-first approach when crafting my designs, ensuring that the user experience remains seamless across various devices and screen sizes.
